BINARY TREES
A project which helps explain the importance of data structures algorithm such as binary trees.
it is called a binary tree because it can only have at most two children. it is also important to note that there is a root node, and a leaf node which is usually the last empty node. Binary search trees are importamt inorder to make quick sort. Feel free to ride with me on this beautifull journey of trees as importamt as a BINARY.
